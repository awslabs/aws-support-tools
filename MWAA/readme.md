# MWAA(Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)

## verify environment
An environment can fail to create for the following reasons [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#t-create-environ-failed)

The `verify_env.py` script will print information support needs to debug these issues. Additionally it will perform checks along with the documented reasons on a best effort basis to help identify the failure. If encountering the error 

```
The scheduler does not appear to be running. Last heartbeat was received XXXXXX ago.

The DAGs list may not update, and new tasks will not be scheduled.
```

This script may identify why.

### Prerequisites
- Python3 is required to run this script
- boto3 1.16.25 or newer

### How to install and run
```
pip3 install boto3 --upgrade --user
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-support-tools.git
python3 aws-support-tools/MWAA/verify_env/verify_env.py --envname YOUR_ENV_NAME_HERE --output /tmp/verify_output.txt
```
The above script is recommended to run on [AWS CloudShell](console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell). Script is expected to run for minutes. Output file can be downloaded from "Actions > Download file" at top right of CloudShell page.

### Logic and api calls
The following actions will be performed in this order:

- print out MWAA environment details to be copies to a support case
- confirm if the role's policies are valid using [IAM policy simulation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html)
- confirm that the KMS CMK has a resource policy allowing airflow's CloudWatch log groups
- confirm that the log groups were created for the environment
    - if the number of current log groups is less than the configured number, the script will check CloudTrail for the failing CreateLogGroup API call.
- confirm that the nACLs allow port 5432 ingress and egress traffic
- confirm the route tables have a route to a NAT gateway if the environment is public
- confirm if the MWAA VPC endpoints(api, ops, env) exist in the MWAA VPC
- confirm that the Amazon VPC network includes 2 private subnets that can access the Internet(if public environment) for creating containers.
- confirm the s3 bucket is blocking public access
- confirm the security groups have
  - at least 1 rule
  - an ingress rule that allows itself
- Call SSM with the document [AWSSupport-ConnectivityTroubleshooter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-connectivitytroubleshooter.html) to confirm connectivity between MWAA and different services
- search logs for any errors and print those to standard output

**Note: SSM automation is charged to the AWS account. For more information [please follow this link](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/#Automation)**.

### Development

#### Dependencies
The unit tests depend on the following Python modules, please install them with pip3 before proceeding:
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html#calling-pytest-through-python-m-pytest) a unit testing framework.
- [moto mock](http://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/) a library for mocking the APIs of AWS services.

#### Unit tests
Run the unit tests using the command: `MOTO_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789123 python3 -m pytest`

Note: the account id above is used to create a "virtual" Moto account. It can be any id, but one *must* be provided.
